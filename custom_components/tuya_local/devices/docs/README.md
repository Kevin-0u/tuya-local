# Device Informations Files

This directory contains device information files, including manufacturer manuals and YAML files with device details retrieved from the Tuya IoT Developer Portal. These files are not directly used by Tuya Local but serve as references for developing device configuration files.

The YAML files include device details and data models (Data Points). They are obtained via the Tuya IoT API Explorer, with unnecessary information removed and converted from JSON to YAML format.
